# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Homework Description

In this homework assignment I have created a timed quiz using multiple choice questions to test the user's coding knowledge. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It also features a clean and polished user interface and is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

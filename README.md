# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

In this homework assignment I have created a timed quiz using multiple choice questions to test the user's coding knowledge. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## User Story

SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
